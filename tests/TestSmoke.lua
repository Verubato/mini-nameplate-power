-- Loads the whole addon into a mocked client and drives it through login.
-- The shared body lives in build/Lua/SmokeTest.lua.

-- Logs in as a Death Knight: the addon checks the player's class before it sets anything up,
-- so any other class would smoke test an addon that deliberately did nothing.
